The <rect> element is used to create a rectangle and variations of a rectangle shape.

The <rect> element has six basic attributes to position and shape the rectangle:

Attribute	Description
width	Required. The width of the rectangle
height	Required. The height of the rectangle
x	The x-position for the top-left corner of the rectangle
y	The y-position for the top-left corner of the rectangle
rx	The x radius of the corners of the rectangle (used to round the corners). Default is 0
ry	The y radius of the corners of the rectangle (used to round the corners). Default is 0

The style attribute is used to define CSS properties for the rectangle
The CSS fill property defines the fill color of the rectangle
The CSS stroke-width property defines the width of the border of the rectangle
The CSS stroke property defines the color of the border of the rectangle

Single <svg> → when shapes are part of one drawing/diagram/logo.

Multiple <svg> → when shapes are independent (icons, separate figures, UI elements).

👉 Most of the time, developers use a single <svg> tag with multiple shapes.

The <circle> element is used to create a circle.

The <circle> element has three basic attributes to position and set the size of the circle:

Attribute	Description
r	Required. The radius of the circle
cx	The x-axis center of the circle. Default is 0
cy	The y-axis center of the circle. Default is 0
An SVG Circle
The following example creates a circle:

SVG Line - <line>
The <line> element is used to create a line.

The <line> element creates a line between the start position (x1,y1) and the end position (x2,y2).

The <line> element has four basic attributes to position and set the length of the line:

Attribute	Description
x1	The start of the line on the x-axis
y1	The start of the line on the y-axis
x2	The end of the line on the x-axis
y2	The end of the line on the y-axis
The <polygon> element is used to create a graphic that contains at least three sides.

Polygons are made of straight lines, and the shape is "closed" (it automatically connects the last point with the first).

The <polygon> element has one basic attribute that defines the points of the polygon:

Attribute	Description
points	Required. The list of points of the polygon. Each point must contain an x coordinate and a y coordinate
A Polygon With Three Sides
The following example creates a polygon with three sides:

Here is the SVG code:

Example
<svg height="220" width="500" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <polygon points="100,10 150,190 50,190" style="fill:lime;stroke:purple;stroke-width:3" />
</svg>
Code explanation:

The points attribute defines the x and y coordinates for each corner of the polygon
M 20 20 → Move the pen to (20, 20).

L 20 150 → Line down to (20, 150).

L 350 150 → Line across to (350, 150).

L 350 20 → Line up to (350, 20).

Z → Close path, connecting back to the start.

That gives you a filled red rectangle with top-left at (20, 20) and bottom-right at (350, 150).
Step-by-step points:

M 20 20 → Move to (20,20) → top-left corner

L 20 150 → Line to (20,150) → bottom-left corner

L 350 150 → Line to (350,150) → bottom-right corner

L 350 20 → Line to (350,20) → top-right corner

Z → Close path → connects back to (20,20)

So the four corners of your red rectangle are:

(20,20) → top-left

(20,150) → bottom-left

(350,150) → bottom-right

(350,20) → top-right
